# Loan_Approval_Using_Python

After performing a thorough data analysis on the bank's loan approval dataset using Python and various libraries, it was determined that the Naive Bayes Classifier is the most effective model for predicting loan eligibility. This model achieved an accuracy of 82%, outperforming other machine learning techniques. The analysis revealed that married men with dependents who are self-employed and have a strong credit history are more likely to be approved for a loan.

Key Points
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Utilized Python libraries such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
Cleaned the dataset and added new columns to enhance data analysis.
Focused on key factors such as gender, marital status, credit history, loan amount, dependents, and self-employment status.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed loan approval rates across different demographics and credit-related variables.
Visualized data distributions and relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Model Evaluation:

Applied multiple machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
Naive Bayes Classifier emerged as the best-performing model with an 82% accuracy rate in predicting loan approval.
Insights:

Identified that married men with dependents, who are self-employed and possess a favorable credit history, have a higher likelihood of loan approval.
